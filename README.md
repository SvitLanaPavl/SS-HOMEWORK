# SS-HOMEWORK

Here is the the EPAM (self-study) homework I did following the lesson plans and the requirements for every module.

HW1: I was supposed to use various semantic and structural html tags to create the page according to the template given. 

HW2: The main goal was to improve the page by only using the given attributes (not adding or changing attributes), using pseudo elements and classes to create the page according to the template given.

HW3: In this section the main goal was to master SASS and use Koala to synchronize changes. I had to use variables and @mixins to re-use data effectively.

HW4: Again, my goal was to polish the use of CSS; however, this homework was dedicated to responsive design. Besdies, I was supposed to utilize Pixel Perfect Extension in order to maximize the resemblance of my page with the template design.
